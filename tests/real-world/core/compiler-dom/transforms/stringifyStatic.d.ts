 * Turn eligible hoisted static trees into stringified static nodes, e.g.
 *
 * ```js
 * const _hoisted_1 = createStaticVNode(`<div class="foo">bar</div>`)
 * ```
 *
 * A single static vnode can contain stringified content for **multiple**
 * consecutive nodes (element and plain text), called a "chunk".
 * `@vue/runtime-dom` will create the content via innerHTML in a hidden
 * container element and insert all the nodes in place. The call must also
 * provide the number of nodes contained in the chunk so that during hydration
 * we can know how many nodes the static vnode should adopt.
 *
 * The optimization scans a children list that contains hoisted nodes, and
 * tries to find the largest chunk of consecutive hoisted nodes before running
 * into a non-hoisted node or the end of the list. A chunk is then converted
 * into a single static vnode and replaces the hoisted expression of the first
 * node in the chunk. Other nodes in the chunk are considered "merged" and
 * therefore removed from both the hoist list and the children array.
 *
 * This optimization is only performed in Node.js.
